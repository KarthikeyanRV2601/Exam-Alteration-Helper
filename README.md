# Exam-Alteration-Helper
<h2>PROJECT AIM</h2>
To build a Web application that makes the exam invigilation exchange process simple, flexible
and efficient.
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
Because of several inexplicable reasons, teachers might find themselves unable to invigilate
examinations that they have been assigned. Finding a replacement can be a tiresome and
messy process. YEAH attempts to solve this problem by providing an easy to use web
application that allows faculty to request for replacements and other faculty to accept these
requests.
It also provides an interface for exam supervisors to schedule exams and allot them to specific
faculty.
All in all, YEAH offers a complete and robust solution for exam alteration and provides a
smooth and problem free method to schedule exams.
